# Explore-Movie-Datasets
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

# What do I will use for the project?

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

# Project Details
# Introduction

I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents my findings. I will start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I will  use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that attracts my attention, and create a report sharing the answers. I will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I will make it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
